# Vanilla Vite Template

Thank you for checking out this demo template! This project is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fast development and easy customization.

---

## What is this?

This is a clean, minimal starter template using Vite â€” a modern frontend build tool.  
You can preview the live demo, customize the code, and use it for your own projects.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to run the template locally on your machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-demo-repo.git
cd your-demo-repo
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14 or higher recommended).

Run this command to install:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

Start the local dev server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open the project in your default browser at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### 4. Build for production (optional)

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled files will be generated in the `dist` folder.

## How to Customize

This template uses **Tailwind CSS** with a custom configuration for colors, fonts, and layout.

### Tailwind Configuration Highlights

- **Container** is centered with responsive max-widths:
  - `sm`: 100%
  - `md`: 768px
  - `lg`: 1000px
  - `xl`: 1200px
- **Colors** include a custom `neutral` palette and `primary` shades.
- **Font sizes** are customized with semantic names like `headline-1`, `body-1`, etc.

You can find the full Tailwind config in `tailwind.config.js`:
